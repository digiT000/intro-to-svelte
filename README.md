# Svelte Learning Journey

Welcome to my Svelte learning repository! 🎯

This repo is dedicated to documenting and exploring my **learning process with Svelte** — a modern JavaScript framework for building fast and reactive user interfaces.

## 📚 What This Repo Is About

- My **step-by-step learning progress** in Svelte
- Hands-on **exploration of Svelte features**
- Trying out **components, transitions, stores**, and more
- Simple examples and experiments — **not production code**

## 💡 Why I Created This

I wanted a space to:

- Practice Svelte through small, focused examples
- Get familiar with how Svelte differs from other frameworks (like React or Vue)
- Keep track of what I've learned

## 🚫 What This Repo Is NOT

- Not a boilerplate for projects
- Not a production-ready app
- Not a tutorial for others — just my personal learning log

## 🛠️ Topics I’ve Explored (So Far)

- Svelte syntax and file structure (`.svelte`)
- Reactive variables and declarations

> This list will grow as I continue learning!

Feel free to look around if you're curious — but remember this is all experimental and exploratory. 🚧
