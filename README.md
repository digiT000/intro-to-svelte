# Svelte Learning Journey

Welcome to my Svelte learning repository! 🎯

This repo is dedicated to documenting and exploring my **learning process with Svelte** — a modern JavaScript framework for building fast and reactive user interfaces.

## 📚 What This Repo Is About

- My **step-by-step learning progress** in Svelte
- Hands-on **exploration of Svelte features**
- Trying out **components, transitions, stores**, and more
- Simple examples and experiments — **not production code**

## 💡 Why I Created This

I wanted a space to:

- Practice Svelte through small, focused examples
- Get familiar with how Svelte differs from other frameworks (like React or Vue)
- Keep track of what I've learned

## 🚫 What This Repo Is NOT

- Not a boilerplate for projects
- Not a production-ready app
- Not a tutorial for others — just my personal learning log

## 🛠️ Topics I’ve Explored (So Far)

- Svelte syntax and file structure (`.svelte`)
- Reactive variables and declarations

> This list will grow as I continue learning!

---

Feel free to look around if you're curious — but remember this is all experimental and exploratory. 🚧

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
